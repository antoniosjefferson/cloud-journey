## Learning Log

- **April 28, 2025**: Completed Module 1 of AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials. Set up this repo and began documenting my journey. Will update every Sunday or Monday.

- **May 5, 2025**: Completed Module 2 of the AWS course. Created personal flashcards in Anki to master core concepts. Confident this will pay off.

- **May 12, 2025**: Busy life week, but I completed Module 3 of the course in one day (today) to catch up after a slow week. Anki cards are in and studying them has started. Going to pick up the pace this week to stay on track to finish the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course by mid June.

## AWS Cloud Anki Cards

Q: What are the five EC2 instance families?
A: General purpose, Compute optimized, Memory optimized, Accelerated computing, and Storage optimized.

Q: What are General Purpose instances used for?
A: Balanced compute, memory, and networking. Good for app servers, web servers, and small to medium databases.

Q: What are Compute Optimized instances best for?
A: High-performance compute workloads like batch processing, web servers, and dedicated game servers.

Q: What workloads suit Memory Optimized instances?
A: Applications that process large datasets in memory, like in-memory databases and real-time big data analytics.

Q: What’s the purpose of Accelerated Computing instances?
A: Offload compute tasks like floating-point math, graphics processing, and machine learning with hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs).

Q: When should you use Storage Optimized instances?
A: For workloads that need high, sequential read/write access to large, locally stored datasets (e.g., OLTP, data warehousing).

Q: What are On-Demand instances?
A: No contracts, pay for what you use. Best for testing or unpredictable workloads.

Q: What are Reserved Instances?
A: Commit to 1–3 years in exchange for a discount. Ideal for steady workloads.

Q: What is a Savings Plan in EC2?
A: Flexible pricing plan based on a committed hourly spend, not tied to specific instance types.

Q: What are Spot Instances?
A: Unused EC2 capacity with up to 90% discount. Can be interrupted. Good for flexible workloads.

Q: What is a Dedicated Host?
A: Physical server dedicated to your use. Most expensive option. Needed for compliance or licensing.

Q: What is Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?
A: A service that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.

Q: What is Dynamic vs. Predictive Scaling?
A: Dynamic reacts to demand in real time. Predictive schedules changes based on forecasts. You can use both.

Q: What does “desired capacity” mean in Auto Scaling?
A: The target number of EC2 instances; if not set, it defaults to the minimum capacity.

Q: What does an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) do?
A: Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve fault tolerance.
